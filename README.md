# Casino Game - Python Project
Welcome to the Casino Game Python project! This project is designed to help beginners and intermediate Python developers enhance their skills while building a simple casino game using Python fundamentals.

## Game Description
The Casino Game allows users to deposit a certain amount of money, which they can then use to place bets on one, two, or three slot machines. The objective is to match symbols across the reels to win prizes. If a user lands on any winning lines, their bet is multiplied by the value of the line and added to their balance until they decide to cash out.

## How to play:
- Deposit Money: Start by depositing a certain amount of money to begin playing.

- Choose Slot Machines: Select the number of slot machines you want to bet on (1, 2, or 3).

- Place Bets: Enter the amount you want to bet on each slot machine.

- Spin the Reels: Watch the reels spin and wait to see if you've landed on any winning combinations.

- Collect Winnings: If you win, your bet will be multiplied by the value of the winning line and added to your balance.

- Cash Out: Decide when you want to cash out and end the game. Your remaining balance will be displayed.

## Project Structure
- Text-Based Interface: The game uses a simple text-based interface for ease of use.
Multiple Slot Machines: Players can choose to bet on one, two, or three slot machines for added excitement.
- Winning Lines: The game checks for winning combinations across the reels and calculates winnings accordingly.
- Balance Tracking: Users can track their balance throughout the game and decide when to cash out.

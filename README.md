# Casino Game - Python Project
Welcome to the Casino Game Python project! This project is designed to help beginners and intermediate Python developers enhance their skills while building a simple casino game using Python fundamentals.

## Game Description
The casino game implemented in this project simulates a simplified version of a casino game where players can bet on the outcome of rolling dice. Players are given an initial balance, and they can place bets on lines .

## How to play:
- Deposit Money: Start by depositing a certain amount of money to begin playing.

- Choose Slot Machines: Select the number of slot machines you want to bet on (1, 2, or 3).

- Place Bets: Enter the amount you want to bet on each slot machine.

- Spin the Reels: Watch the reels spin and wait to see if you've landed on any winning combinations.

- Collect Winnings: If you win, your bet will be multiplied by the value of the winning line and added to your balance.

- Cash Out: Decide when you want to cash out and end the game. Your remaining balance will be displayed.

## Project Structure
- Text-Based Interface: The game uses a simple text-based interface for ease of use.
Multiple Slot Machines: Players can choose to bet on one, two, or three slot machines for added excitement.
- Winning Lines: The game checks for winning combinations across the reels and calculates winnings accordingly.
- Balance Tracking: Users can track their balance throughout the game and decide when to cash out.
